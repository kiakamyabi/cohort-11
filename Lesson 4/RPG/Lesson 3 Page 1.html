    Blinding light.<br><br>
    It is the first thing you see as you try to open your eyes.<br><br>
    Slowly the light dims to a tolerable level.<br><br>
    A faint high pitched noise rings in your ears. <br><br>
    As you gather your wits you realise you are in an empty but pure white room. There are no walls. There is nothing here. Nothing at all. <br><br>
    Why are YOU here? <br><br>
    Suddenly, all around you, you hear a maniacal howls of laughter. <br><br>
    You remember.<br><br>
    Your task.
    Your duty.
    Your quest.<br><br>
    You must destroy the Andy to save all of mankind. <br><br>
    You will have the last laugh. <br><br>
