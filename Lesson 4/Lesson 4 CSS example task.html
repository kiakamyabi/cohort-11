        The maniacal laughs get louder and closer to you by the second.<br><br>
        The light in the room begins to fade. Darkness begins to sweep behind you. <br> <br>
        You hear some kind of mechanical sound. It is familar to you yet you aren't sure what it is.<br><br>
        The sound of a lever being pulled?<br><br>
        A hammer slamming down?<br><br>
        Someone's... foot crashing down?<br><br>
        A giant figure draped in shadows begins to march out of the all consuming darkness. You realise what the mechanical sound is.<br><br>
        It is Andy. Andy riding a treadmill. <br><br>
        His speed begins to pick up and the treadmill moves forward destroying everything in front of it. <br><br>
        Of course he can defy the laws of physics. It's Andy.<br><br>
        It's time to go. Now. <br><br>
        You sprint in the opposite direction. Andy starts to close the gap. One step at a time the treadmill picks up speed. <br><br>
        Fear begins to consume you. Is this the end? The quest has hardly begun!<br><br>
        In the distance you spot two doors. A way out. <br><br>
        Two signs protrude out of the ground with an arrow pointing at each door. <br><br>
        You calm yourself enough to read it. Despite the terrifying laughs from Andy edging ever closer to you. <br><br>
        Swansea. Bath Spa.<br><br>
        You can only choose one door to head towards. <br><br>
        What is your decision? <br><br>
