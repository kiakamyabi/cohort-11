    <title>Page 4 Swansea Violence</title>
</head>
<body>
    You choose violence. <br><br>
    No army nor navy of killer robotic swans will stop you from your mission.<br><br>
    You ask the the narrator to give you a giant laser gattling gun. <br><br>
    The narrator obliges. <br><br>
    Thankfully, this time the queen can't stop you from going on a swan killing spree. <br><br>
    It's show time. <br><br>
    The swans immediately recognize the danger and begin to swarm you. Lasers shoot from their eyes to explode around you.<br><br>
    "Nice aim, noobs." You cheekly remark.<br><br>
    You wield the giant metal laser gattling gun in both your hands. You've been waiting for this your whole life.<br><br>
    You pull the trigger and hold. <br><br>
    The sound of futuristic whirling plays out like a melody to your ears as the gun powers up. <br><br>
    A stream of scorching laser beams shoot out and giant explosions echo out across the sea as the swans fall one by one. <br><br>
    Shrapnel pieces of the metal swans fly across everywhere. One even cuts your cheek. Yet you don't let go of the trigger. <br><br>
    The swans begin to flee and scatter in terror. Afraid for their robotic lives? You ponder. Yet you don't let go of the trigger. <br><br>
    All you can see is fiery death before you. The gattling gun begins to power down. Out of ammo? Yet you never let go of the trigger. <br><br>
    You're pretty sure you just committed several swan warcrimes but as you left no witnesses you should be ok.<br><br>
    The narrator agrees he saw nothing. <br><br>
    What's left of the corpses of the robotic swans make a convenient bridge to your destination. <br><br>
    You hop across till you reach the other island where the beaming light had come from. <br><br>
    There it is. The cerficiate. With this you can save Cohort 11. With this you can defeat the Andy. The final battle can now begin. <br><br>
    As you pick up the cerficate a new door appears.<br><br>
