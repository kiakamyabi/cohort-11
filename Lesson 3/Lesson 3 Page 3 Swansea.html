        You sprint at a speed you did not know you could achieve. <br> <br>
        Just in time you make it to the door as Andy reaches to grab you. <br><br>
        Up close you see his figure right as you close the doors.<br><br>
        Part man. Part sheep. A true horror. <br><br>
        As you turn around to put your back against the wall you look to scout your new surroundings.<br><br>
        There is mist everywhere.<br><br>
        As you breathe the air in you recognize the smell. Are you near a lake? The sea?<br><br>
        A cold breeze chills you. <br><br>
        Now you understand where you are. On a small island. <br><br>
        In the distance a bright light shoots up into the sky. <br><br>
        Your objective. The Certificate is there. With it you can slay the Andy to finally free your people. <br><br>
        To liberate Cohort 11. <br><br>
        This should be easy. You can just swim there. Maybe things won't be so bad. <br><br>
        The mist begins to dissipate. Now you can see the water clearly.<br><br>
        Now you can see the armada of moderately sized robotic killer swans in your way. <br><br>
        Their eyes glow red. Their metal beaks shine against the dimmed sunlight. <br><br>
        A swan sea. <br><br>
        It is Andy's killer AI. A formidable foe. You will need to get across somehow. <br><br>
        What is your decision? <br><br>
