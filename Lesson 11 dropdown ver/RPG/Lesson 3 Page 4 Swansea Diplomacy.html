    You choose diplomacy. <br><br>
    No army nor navy of killer robotic swans will stop you from your mission.<br><br>
    You ask the the narrator to give you a giant laser gattling gun. <br><br>
    The narrator obliges. <br><br>
    You shout out to the swans. <br><br>
    "We can do this the easy way or the hard way! I just want the certificate." <br><br>
    A giant swan paddles to you, far bigger than the others. It wears a crown. The Queen of Swansea.<br><br>
    The swan's beak opens back and forth but does not match the cadence of her voice. <br><br>
    "Thou darest to sully our kingdom with thine presence. The presence of a peasant?" She loudly exclaims.<br><br>
    The swan's metal expression does not change. Probably cannot change. But you can feel the disgust she has for you. She looks down on you. <br><br>
    "Er... I just need to get the certificate so I can save Cohort 11." You meekly say. <br><br>
    The swan eyes you up and down. Then begins to let out an obnoxious laugh. <br><br>
    "Behold this fool." The swan turns to her flock. <br><br>
    "He wishes to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thou art truly a peasant." <br><br>
    All the other swans begin to join in on the bullying. They are all laughing at you. <br><br>
    "We here in Swansea art entrepreneurs. We dropship, bro. Get with the times. Thee may swimeth to thy destination if it so pleases thine peasant ways." <br><br>
    You diplomatically pull the laser gattling gun trigger and diplomatically hold it. <br><br>
    What happens in Swansea, stays in Swansea.<br><br>
    The Queen Swan's expression does not change but you can feel the horror as she realises what you plan to do. <br><br>
    The sound of futuristic whirling plays out like a melody to your ears as the gun powers up. <br><br>
    A stream of diplomatic scorching laser beams shoot out and giant explosions echo out across the sea as the swans fall one by one. <br><br>
    Shrapnel pieces of the metal swans fly across everywhere. One even cuts your cheek. Yet you don't let go of the trigger. <br><br>
    The swans begin to flee and scatter in terror. Afraid for their robotic lives? You ponder. Yet you diplomatically don't let go of the trigger. <br><br>
    All you can see is fiery death before you. The gattling gun begins to power down. Out of ammo? Yet you never let go of the trigger. <br><br>
    You're pretty sure you just committed several diplomatic swan warcrimes but as you left no witnesses you should be ok.<br><br>
    The narrator agrees he saw nothing. Diplomacy has suceeded.<br><br>
    The Queen Swan's crown lies on the floor. You put it on. You look baller. <br><br>
    What's left of the corpses of the robotic swans make a convenient diplomatic bridge to your destination. <br><br>
    You hop across till you reach the other island where the beaming light had come from. <br><br>
    There it is. The cerficiate. With this you can save Cohort 11. With this you can defeat the Andy. The final battle can now begin. <br><br>
    As you pick up the cerficate a new door appears.<br><br>
